# ETHER-ARTS, CONTRACTS BUG BOUNTY(~ 4 APR, 2019)
The world's first crypto-collectible card with direct ethereum compensation.

### About Ether-arts
The Ether-arts is a collectible art card with a built-in lottery ticket function. The Smart contract accumulates 50% of total card sales to create a pool of rewards, and choose two new winner card types every 10 days. If there are lots of winners, they share the reward pool using predefined rules. If there's no winner, the reward pool is accumulated into the next lottery's reward. The prize reward is paid as a form of ethereum, and all the cards are reusable. Both winning and losing cards are never discarded nor functionally limited.
All card types can be published up to maximum supply of pre-determined quantity by color attribute. Therefore, if you have a more rare type of card, you will receive a larger winning reward because there will be fewer winners.
Ether-arts card complies with the ERC721 standard on ethereum, so it can be bought / transferred / sold between users. We already integrated user-to-user market inside our website. If certain card type is sold out, user-to-user market mode is enabled. Card owner can suggest bid price at the [MY COLLECTION] menu.

We are currently on the Rinkeby test network, so this bountry hunt will take place within the Rinkeby network.
